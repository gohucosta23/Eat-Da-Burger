## Info

<p>This project we used a npm package called <a href ="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars">"express-handlebars"</a>. Handlebars. js is a popular templating engine that is powerful, simple to use and has a large community. It is based on the Mustache template language, but improves it in several important ways.

<p> Also, we are using object-relational mapper (ORM). <a href = "https://www.js-data.io/docs/what-is-an-orm">ORM</a> is a code library that automates the transfer of data stored in relational databases tables into objects that are more commonly used in application code. </p>

<p> As far as design we are using an application design model comprised of three interconnected parts called  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">"Model-View-Controller"</a> or MVC. The MVC model or "pattern" is commonly used for developing modern user interfaces. It is provides the fundamental pieces for designing a programs for desktop or mobile, as well as web applications.
